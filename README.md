# WiT Fingerprint Dashboard

A web-based fingerprint sensor interface built with Arduino and Flask, designed for **cyber awareness education**.  
This project allows enrolling, searching, deleting fingerprints, and associates each fingerprint with a user name. It also includes a web dashboard with live logs and a database view.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Use Case

This project is built for **cyber awareness / security education** to demonstrate biometric authentication. It helps users understand concepts such as:
- fingerprint scanning and template storage  
- user identity mapping (ID + name)  
- real-time logging of sensor operations  
- web interfaces interacting with hardware  
- risks and best practices around biometric systems (e.g. template deletion, replay, spoofing, etc.)

- Jumper wires  
- USB cable  

### Software & Libraries
- Arduino IDE  
- Adafruit Fingerprint Sensor Library  
- Python 3

## ðŸš€ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rein-desu999/fingerprint.git
   cd fingerprint
Install Python dependencies

python3 -m pip install flask pyserial


Upload Arduino sketch

Open the Arduino .ino in Arduino IDE

Install the Adafruit Fingerprint library

Wire the fingerprint sensor (sensor VIN â†’ 5V, GND â†’ GND, TX â†’ Arduino pin 2, RX â†’ Arduino pin 3)

Upload the sketch

Set the serial port in app.py
In app.py, update the line:

SERIAL_PORT = "/dev/tty.usbmodem101"


to match the port your Arduino uses (check via ls /dev/tty.*).

Run the Flask web app

python3 app.py


Open a browser at http://localhost:5000/.

Use the web dashboard

On the Control Panel tab, you can enroll, search, or delete a fingerprint by entering an ID and a name

On the Database tab, you can see all enrolled users, edit names inline, and delete records
